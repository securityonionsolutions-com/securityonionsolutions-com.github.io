This talk is about how I integrated Security Onion into the class as a teaching platform to provide that experience in detection engineering, alert investigation, threat hunting, and more."

        "description": "Tuning NSM sensors is often tedious, reactive, and error-prone. Teams spend many hours manually tuning Zeek and Suricata configurations to balance detection fidelity with packet loss and operational overhead. Static tuning approaches often fall short in dynamic environments, leading to degraded performance and operational frustration.<p class=\"my-2\">AI2Tune is an open framework designed to auto-tune network sensors for optimal operation. By combining machine learning and adaptive heuristics, AI2Tune continuously analyzes performance telemetry, such as packet drops, queue stats and system utilization, recommending or applying configuration changes in real time.<p class=\"my-2\">This presentation will demonstrate how AI2Tune learns baseline behavior, predicts emerging bottlenecks, and dynamically adjusts sensor configuration to maintain reliable coverage. While AI2Tune is platform-agnostic, examples will focus on integrating with Security Onion deployments, including strategies for safely applying tuning changes via SaltStack and maintaining compatibility with managed configurations.<p class=\"my-2\">AI2Tune can ingest metrics from ElasticSearch, InfluxDB, Prometheus, and local logs, detect deteriorating performance patterns, and trigger adjustments through Salt, Ansible, or API workflows. The system supports fully automated or recommendation-only modes, giving operators flexibility and visibility into each tuning decision.<p class=\"my-2\">Attendees will see practical examples of how AI2Tune can improve sensor performance, enhance operational resilience, and will become familiar with lessons learned from deploying adaptive tuning."

The goal for these playbooks is simple: provide a structure for documenting investigative playbooks that is flexible, intuitive, and genuinely helpful to human analysts during incident investigation and response.<p class=\"my-2\">Chris Sanders will begin by unpacking the theory behind this human-centered approach, grounded in cognitive science and investigative reasoning. You'll learn how traditional playbooks fall short, and how cognitive playbooks can improve decision-making, reduce analyst fatigue, and enable consistent, high-quality outcomes.<p class=\"my-2\">After that, Josh Brower will demonstrate how this model has been integrated into Security Onion, showing off the new Guided Analysis feature that was recently released. He'll walk through a real-world example of a detection scenario using a playbook built into the platform, highlighting how the tool empowers analysts to make informed choices.<p class=\"my-2\">Finally, we'll wrap up by describing some best practices for creating playbooks as an educational exercise with a practical outcome. Analysts, SOC leaders, and tool builders should walk away from this talk with a better understanding of how to effectively use investigative playbooks, and a few tools for helping them along that path."
