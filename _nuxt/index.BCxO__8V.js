We will also cover how we can pivot to Sublime for in-depth investigation and analysis of suspicious emails, extracting valuable context and indicators to inform security decisions.<p class='my-2'/>Last, we will discuss how we can enrich and correlate Sublime alerts with the various data sources in Security Onion, such as Zeek HTTP/DNS/TLS records, Suricata alerts, and full PCAP to answer questions with network metadata such as: Did the user click on the link? Has anyone ever visited this domain or link before? And more.
